This is a Next.js project for my personal development in webDev.
Initially I wanted to use and display data of an API i'm interested in. Found the [PokéAPI](https://pokeapi.co/) and combined it with the [Pokémon TradingCardGame API](https://pokemontcg.io/) to look up TradingCards.
I also used this Project to get used with [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) and take it's advantage.

Still under development, but take a look. It's working thou.
